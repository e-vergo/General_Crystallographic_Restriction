  "paperTitle": "The Crystallographic Restriction Theorem: A Formalized Proof in Lean 4",
  "paperAuthors": ["J. Kuzmanovich", "A. Pavlichenkov", "E. Vergo"],
  "paperAbstract": "We present a complete formalization in Lean 4 of the crystallographic restriction theorem, which characterizes the possible finite orders of integer matrices. The theorem states that an N×N integer matrix can have finite multiplicative order m if and only if ψ(m) ≤ N, where ψ is a specific arithmetic function. This result has classical applications to crystallography, explaining why crystals exhibit only 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotational symmetries."
